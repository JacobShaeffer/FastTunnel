TODO: Phase 1
-game:
	attach background and tunnel together to ensure sync
	change the way tunnel moves, instead of the pseudo movmenet they do make them actually move (do the same thing as background, but the collision bars will remain in place)
		this will allow changes in speed
	for background and tunnel
	-change positioning to be on a very large grid (10,000+ ?) and use rounding to get pixel position
	-this will allow use of delta to calculate position based on time passed not based on processor speed
-go through and make sure nothing is relying directly on processor speed to update that could cause problems

-memory leak when in global scores screen
-tiny leak in ship menu
	both stop when leaving menu
-leak in game over scree on high score
	pretty much gone on return to main
--all of these leave more in memory than they brought in im pretty sure


TODO: Phase 2
-ship unlocking
-"YOU UNLOCKED A NEW SHIP!!" at end of runs

-highscore names
	-on highscore, check for name
		-if none exists, prompt
		-else allow changes to be made with button
-test rank if 1st(more than likely not first, side affect of sql command)

-finish global scores
